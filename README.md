This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repo. You will need to have NPM and Yarn installed. Please follow instructions on their respective websites if this is something you need to do.
2. You may need to run __yarn install__ to install packages.
3. Run __yarn start__ to start the application.
4. Have fun.
  * Navigate with the menu options in the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
  * Dropdown menus from the navigation bar must be closed manually by clicking the menu button again.
  * You can select one or more files to upload by clicking the "Select Photo" button.
    * To select multiple files, you must select the desired files from your file explorer in the same window (e.g. ctrl + left mouse button in the file explorer).
  * Once files have been selected for upload, selecting different files by clicking the button again will replace the previously selected files.
  * When all desired files have been selected, click the "Upload" button to display your files on the page.
    * Clicking the "Upload" button consecutively will add the same images to the gallery.
  * The only file formats that are accepted are .png, .jpg, .jpeg and .svg.
  * Depending on the screen width, the gallery will display photos in an appropraite number of columns.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn test:coverage`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode and prints a coverage report after running the tests.<br />

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
